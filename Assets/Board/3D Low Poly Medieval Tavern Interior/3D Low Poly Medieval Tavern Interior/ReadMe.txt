Hello, my favorite developer,

thank you for purchasing this asset pack. It really means a lot to me. It contains 30+ models of interior furniture and props to start your game dev journey, or to add more models to your game.

If there are any problems with the models, send me an email and I will fix the issue as soon as possible. Also if there's something that is missing in the pack and you desperately need it for your project, just let me know. I'll consider if it is suitable for this particular pack and if so, I'll add it as soon as possible.

This package also contains a SampleScene for Unity to showcase all the models. There's one special texture for the floor, that is not intended to be used elsewhere, except for the SampleScene. It will not suit any other model.

More packs are coming soon, to make a complete inn:
Kitchen
Guest rooms
Spa
Cellar
Stables
Storage

Number of triangles in this pack:
Max per object - 11K
Min per object - 56
Total - 25,8K

As this pack is free, I really appreciate every donation. As a father of two, I hardly scrape the last bits of my free time to do what I love, which is gamedev and art.

Thanks a lot for your support.
